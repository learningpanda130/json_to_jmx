# Project Overview
This project aims to convert data from various formats into JMX files suitable for JMeter testing. It is designed to simplify the process of performance testing by providing a seamless integration between data sources and JMeter.

# Architecture
The architecture of the project is modular, allowing for the easy addition of new formats and transformation strategies. It consists of three main components: the API crawler, the data transformation pipeline, and the JMeter integration.

# File Structure
- **/api_crawler/**: Contains scripts to scrape data from APIs.
- **/data_transformation/**: Contains scripts for transforming data into the desired format.
- **/jmeter/**: Includes the JMX files generated by the data transformation pipeline.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- JMeter 5.0 or higher
- Requests library (install with `pip install requests`)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/learningpanda130/json_to_jmx.git
   cd json_to_jmx
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

# Usage Workflow
1. **API Crawler**: Use the scripts in the `/api_crawler/` folder to scrape data from the desired API. Make sure to adjust any configuration files with your API keys and endpoints.
2. **Data Transformation**: Run the transformation scripts to convert the scraped JSON data into JMX format using the scripts in `/data_transformation/`.
3. **JMeter Testing**: Open the generated JMX files with JMeter and run your tests.

# API Crawler Flow
The API crawler retrieves data from specified endpoints and saves it locally. Ensure you handle pagination or large datasets appropriately in your scripts.

# Data Transformation Pipeline
The transformation pipeline processes the raw data collected from the API and formats it suitably for JMeter. This step is crucial to ensure that the output can be effectively utilized in performance tests.

# JMeter Testing
Load the generated JMX files in JMeter. Configure your thread groups and run the tests based on the requirements to evaluate system performance.

# Output Artifacts
The resulting JMX files and any logs generated during the testing process are saved in the `/jmeter/` directory for later analysis.

# Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues during installation, ensure that all prerequisites are satisfied. 
- Check API response codes and error messages for the API crawler.
- Review JMeter logs for any issues during test execution.
